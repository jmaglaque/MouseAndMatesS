                <p>I’m <strong>Jay-R D. Maglaque</strong>, 19 years old and a second-year BSIT student in NEUST Sumacab. Finding out that websites are made with HTML and CSS got me excited about web development so, that made me really interested in computers and programming.</p> <br>
                <p>Right now, I’m just going with the flow, exploring web development at my own pace and learning as I go. As a second-year student, I’m taking things one step at a time, balancing my studies with hands-on learning in Web Systems Technology. While I’m currently focused on front-end development, I’m keeping an open mind and might try back-end development someday if it feels right.</p>
